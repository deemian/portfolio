                Who am I? Why should you care? <em> I don't know.</em>
                But you're here, so my name is Demian Horvat, I am 17 at the time of writing this, but I turn 18 on the
                <b>
                    26th of september 2022</b>.
                Which essentially means my free trial of life expires.
                I am currently a student at the Hogeschool Rotterdam, which is also the reason I am creating this
                website.
                Here you will find a bit more about me.

            <li> Former education: VWO at Novum in Voorburg </li>
            <li> Current education: HBO at Hogeschool Rotterdam - CMGT (Creative media and Game Technologies) </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Why transition from VWO to HBO though? I had never been quite fond of school, and I knew if I were to
            continue learning something else,
            it had to be something I truly enjoyed, and not a very difficult university course. Then I found CMGT at the
            Hogeschool Rotterdam, and
            I immediately knew it was perfect for me.

        <p> Like many others, I enjoy gaming, think of Minecraft and GTA 5, but also rythm games and random Steam games.

            I also enjoy making music, first I had guitar lessons for 5 years, and now I've been playing the piano for
            about 2 years.
            Think of Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, but also modern types of piano songs. Pursueing a career in music is
            also a possibility.

            I also have a decent amount of experience with video editing, I made a lot of videos for school and silly
            videos for other purposes.

        <p>I am into anything computer related, so coding and designing really is my thing, which is why I'm doing CMGT!

            I have done athletics and judo for a long time. I have since then quit judo, but I did achieve the brown
            belt before I quit. I still
            run outside regularly to stay in shape and enjoy swimming. I'm good at sprinting and jumping far in
            athletics.
